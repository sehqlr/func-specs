Relativity calendar
	ROUGHT NOTES
		this idea is for synchronizing clocks and calendars on demand
		if you have an event that you want to coordinate with others you 'create' that calendar event independently of others
		events are atomic and a calendar is just a container for a set of them
		the events don't have to follow any kind of standard, except maybe Unix time?
		the calendars would translate an atomic event, a kind of translation from the calendar independent event
