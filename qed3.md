QED3 website: math proofs as art, inspired by QED by Burkard Polster
	Initial notes
		The _QED_ book by Burkard Polster is amazing at showing math proof
		as art. However, many of the drawings were for 3D objects, and although
		the woodcut style is really cool, those figures could be rendered on a
		computer screen to get a different, possibly more immersive effect. My
		idea is to implement the same kind of art style, but with d3.js on the
		web instead of on the page.
	extensions
		there could be a use for an app that contructs the steps in a geometric proof
