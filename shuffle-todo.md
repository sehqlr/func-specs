Shuffling entries in todo.py
	Brian was talking about his system of keeping track of of items todo.
		Append tasks to your list
		When you need to do something, read it in reverse order (FILO)
		Pick out a thing to do, including dependencies
		Cross that item off the list
		If you didn't get it done, reappend it to the list
