	emulate the functionality of a "tickler file"
		31 days + 12 months - 2 months with days in them = 51 buckets for items
		put an item in one of the buckets
		the file for the current day opens up, and you've mailed yourself the original item
	the folders in the tickler file are implemented as directories in your filesystem
	the items in the file are just files
